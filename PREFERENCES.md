# Preferences

The preferences file (`./apps/server/cachedDefaults/preferences.json`) contains configuration settings for the institution search feature.

_See [testPreferences.json](./apps/server/cachedDefaults/testData/testPreferences.json) as a guide. This file has real values filled in._

## Provider Credentials

__NOTE:__ For any providers listed in the section labeled `supportedProviders`, you must provide your own credentials for each of these providers in the `./apps/server/.env` file. You need to have credentials for a minimum of one provider in order for the UCW to function correctly.

Follow these links to sign-up for credentials for each provider that the UCW currently supports:

- MX - [Register for a developer account](https://dashboard.mx.com/sign_up)
  - Once you have created an account, go to [https://dashboard.mx.com/home](https://dashboard.mx.com/home), and look for your `API Key` and `Client ID`. Put those values in `./apps/server/.env`
  - Note that MX requires that your IP address(es) be approved and added to their allow-list, prior to being able to connect. This can be done in their dashboard.
- Sophtron - [Register for a developer account](https://sophtron.com/Account/Register)
  - Once you have created an account, go to [https://sophtron.com/Manage](https://sophtron.com/Manage), and look for your `UserId` and `AccessKey`. Put those values in `./apps/server/.env`

_Note: Providers require a contract to access their production APIs._
