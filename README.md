# Universal Connect Widget (Application)

This repo is a full stack application which anyone can clone and self-host as a way to serve the connect widget via a url which can then be loaded into an iframe.

## Getting Started (in production)

This repo is a full stack application which anyone can clone and self-host as a way to serve the connect widget.

To get started, clone the repo, follow the steps in `Initial Setup`, below to set up your .env file, and then run the following command, from the root of the project:

*This assumes you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) already installed.*
```
docker compose up
```

That's it! If you have questions, please reach out to us.

The images for this repo are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/universalconnectfoundation)

## Getting Started (in development)
1. clone the repo
2. Run `npm ci`
3. Go into the `ui` directory: `cd ./ui`
4. Run `npm ci` in the `ui` directory
5. Go back to the root directory: `cd ..`
6. Copy `.env.example`: `cp ./.env.example ./.env`
7. Follow "Initial setup" (below) for setting-up some required environment variables
8. Finally, run: `npm run ucw-app`

## Initial setup
1. Run `npm run keys` to generate a new set of `key` and `IV` values.
2. Fill in the `CryptoKey` and `CryptoIv` in your newly created `.env` file with the generated `key` and `IV`.
3. Sign up for a UCP client account: [here](https://login.universalconnectproject.org/) (the `Click here to login` link navigates to the aws hosted login page where sign up option is available).
4. Generate and view your client secrets once registered and logged in
5. Fill in the `UcpAuthClientId`, `UcpAuthClientSecret` and `UcpAuthEncryptionKey` in the `.env` file with the values provided by login page.

*Please remember that secrets are passed through environment variables instead of hardcoded in the js file.*
DO NOT put any credentials in any of the js files. If you do so, it could accidentally get committed and leaked to the public.
USE `.env` FILE

*UCP credentials are required for authentication and secret exchange, storage (redis-like session cache) and analytics services.*

*The `CryptoKey` and `CryptoIv` values are for encrypting the session token in order to not rely on cookies. They must be shared across server instances if there are multiple instances.*

* You might see an error about failure to connect redis, the widget doesn't rely on redis to start, but some providers logic require an redis intance, to fix this error you can either: 
- start a local redis instance, this way it will be avaliable at localhost:6379 and the widget will use it
- Or set in `.env` Env=dev, this way the redis client will use local in-mem object to handle the cache and remove the error, however, this is just for some testing, the cached values won't expire and also will be cleared on server restart.
